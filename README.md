# pyforum
A simple forum server (and simple client) written in Python3.

# How it works
It uses sqlite3 to store users, posts, and comments.
It uses Flask to run the actual server itself. It doesn't have a web interface, but it has an API.

# Progress
So far, the server is working fully (more features may be added).
I haven't started the client yet.
Soon, I hope to add usage of pyAuth (https://github.com/AgeOfMarcus/pyAuth) to make it more secure.
